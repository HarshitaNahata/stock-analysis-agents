# 🎥 Demo Script: Multi-Agent Stock Analysis System

## 🎙️ Introduction
"Hi, I'm excited to demo our Multi-Agent System for stock analysis, built using Google ADK and Alpha Vantage API."

## 🔧 Architecture Overview
"This system is modular and consists of five agents:
- `identify_ticker`: Parses stock name and gets ticker
- `ticker_news`: Fetches latest news using Alpha Vantage
- `ticker_price`: Retrieves real-time price
- `ticker_price_change`: Calculates change over time
- `ticker_analysis`: Combines news + price for insights"

## 💻 Demo Start

### 1. Launching the System
"Let’s start by running the main orchestrator."
```bash
python main_orchestrator.py
```

### 2. Query 1: "Why did Tesla stock drop today?"
- Shows `identify_ticker` → TSLA
- `ticker_analysis` pulls price and news

### 3. Query 2: "How has Nvidia stock changed in the last 7 days?"
- `identify_ticker` → NVDA
- `ticker_price_change` shows % change

### 4. Query 3: "What's the current price of Apple?"
- `identify_ticker` → AAPL
- `ticker_price` returns price

### 5. Query 4: "Show me recent news about Palantir."
- `identify_ticker` → PLTR
- `ticker_news` displays headlines

## 🧠 Wrap-Up
"This system uses agent modularity for easy extensibility and integrates data + news for intelligent stock insights."

## ✅ End
"Thanks for watching. Full code is available on GitHub. Feel free to explore or extend it further!"
